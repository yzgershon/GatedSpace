/**
 * Security model for desktop app filesystem access:
 *
 * THREAT MODEL:
 * While a compromised renderer can execute commands via terminal panes,
 * the File Viewer presents a distinct threat: malicious repositories can
 * contain symlinks that trick users into reading/writing sensitive files
 * (e.g., `docs/config.yml` → `~/.bashrc`). Users clicking these links
 * don't know they're accessing files outside the repo.
 *
 * PRIMARY BOUNDARY: assertRegisteredWorktree()
 * - Only worktree paths registered in localDb are accessible via tRPC
 * - Prevents direct filesystem access to unregistered paths
 *
 * SECONDARY: validateRelativePath()
 * - Rejects absolute paths and ".." traversal segments
 * - Defense in depth against path manipulation
 *
 * SYMLINK PROTECTION:
 * - Filesystem operations should delegate to `workspace-fs`. Mutations are
 *   confined to the workspace root; reads are host-wide, but file-content
 *   reads (`readFile`) still reject in-workspace symlinks that resolve
 *   outside the root, so a malicious repo can't disguise a sensitive host
 *   file's contents as a workspace file. `listDirectory`/`getMetadata` don't
 *   apply this check: `getMetadata` lstats (never follows links) and
 *   directory listings only expose entry names.
 * - This module remains focused on registered-worktree and relative-path validation.
