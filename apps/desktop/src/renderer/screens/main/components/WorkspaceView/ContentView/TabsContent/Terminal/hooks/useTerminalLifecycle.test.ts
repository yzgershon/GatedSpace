/**
 * Reproduction tests for issue #1873:
 * "When I switch between terminal tab and browser tab the terminal stuck for a
 * while to load. Additionally, the terminal leaving a large blank space."
 *
 * Root cause: `scheduleReattachRecovery` in useTerminalLifecycle.ts silently
 * drops recovery requests when called within the 120ms throttle window, with
 * no retry scheduled.
 *
 * When a user returns from an external browser to the Electron app, the
 * `window.focus` event fires and schedules reattach recovery. This recovery:
 *   1. Re-fits the terminal to its container (`fitAddon.fit()`)
 *   2. Forces a full repaint (`xterm.refresh()`)
 *
 * If the user switches focus multiple times in rapid succession (within 120ms),
 * subsequent recovery calls hit the throttle and return early — without ever
 * scheduling a retry. The terminal stays blank/stale until the next container
 * resize event (which may never come).
 *
 * Fix: when the throttle fires, schedule a retry after the remaining throttle
 * duration instead of silently returning.
